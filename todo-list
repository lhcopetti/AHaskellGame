21/12/2017
	OK! Add project name, e-mail and etc to stack.
	OK! Push project to GitHub
	OK! Add Velocity to the ball

22/12/2017
	OK! Improve main ball creation. Stop using those triangle patterns, maybe 
		it is time to fire up monad transformers?
	OK! Join the two different balls and keep the funcionality (bounded)

04/01/2018
	OK! Add a square that has the same behavior as the ball (collision).
	OK! Add another class (Squares?) that will have the same behavior (bounded and velocity), see what 
	holds still and what needs refactoring.

07/01/2018
	OK! Create type class for Position
	OK! Create type class for PhysicsBehavior
	OK! Create a method that bounds the object to a certain "box" using those type classes
	OK! Implement those type classes as instances for the Ball and Square data type
	OK! Simplify their update methods (duplicated logic)
	OK! Fix duplication on main loop function
	TODO: Fix "Missing field in record construction button"

	TODO: Add acceleration to the PhysicsBehavior
	TODO: Create a new set of objects (Triangles, maybe?)
	TODO: Add acceleration behavior for the triangles 

	TODO: Create another type of object  that will "die" after 'n' collisions.
		Like a time bomb (Maybe use a sprite for this one?)
